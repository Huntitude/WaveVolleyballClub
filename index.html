Despite this, I am thrilled to step back on the court as a coach this upcoming season. My desire is to lead a team that shows the love of Christ both on and off the court. I believe volleyball is a great way to develop our characters both physically and spiritually. This will be my first year coaching and I am looking forward to helping each and every girl on my team excel.</p>

In my early teen years I fell in love with a game of volleyball, as my church youth group played volleyball on Sundays. As time went by, I got involved in variety of volleyball tournaments and leagues around Tulsa. With that involvement my passion and my skill grew quickly! By early 20s I was playing regularly in competitive leagues and tournaments; which included: co-ed, men's, quads and doubles on sand. In my mid 20s, I had the previlage to coach a wide range of ages, ranging from 8 to 16 years of age, under the supervision of one of the best coaches in Tulsa area, lnna Felkins. I was an assistant coach at a Green County Volleyball Club, as well as Tulsa Volleyball Academy, where I coached with Ronaldo Pacheco, who is currently coaching volleyball at Ole Miss University. I'm looking forward to sharing my experience, as well as to learn. Because, if one is not learning, he/she is not improving!</p>

                <p>My name is Peter. Originally I'm from Europe, but to be more specific, from Russia. In my early teen years I fell in love with a game of volleyball, as my church youth group played volleyball on Sundays. As time went by, I got involved in variety of volleyball tournaments and leagues around Tulsa. With that involvement my passion and my skill grew quickly! By early 20s I was playing regularly in competitive leagues and tournaments; which included: co-ed, men's, quads and doubles on sand.<br><br>In my mid 20s, I had the previlage to coach a wide range of ages, ranging from 8 to 16 years of age, under the supervision of one of the best coaches in Tulsa area, lnna Felkins. I was an assistant coach at a Green County Volleyball Club, as well as Tulsa Volleyball Academy, where I coached with Ronaldo Pacheco, who is currently coaching volleyball at Ole Miss University.<br><br>I'm looking forward to sharing my experience, as well as to learn. Because, if one is not learning, he/she is not improving!</p>
